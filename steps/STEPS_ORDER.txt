# YX Build Steps Execution Order

# Step 0 must always be first - Collects configuration and determines language
ybs-step_000000000000.md

# After Step 0, execution continues based on selected language:
#
# If Python selected:
#   Continue with steps in python/STEPS_ORDER.txt
#
# If Swift selected:
#   Continue with steps in swift/STEPS_ORDER.txt
#
# If Both selected:
#   Execute Python steps first (generates canonical artifacts)
#   Then execute Swift steps (validates against canonical artifacts)
